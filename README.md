## Features

- Add new tasks with a specified priority level.
- Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- Edit existing tasks to update their text.
- Delete tasks are also added.
- Filter tasks based on priority (low, medium, high).
- Local storage integration to persist tasks even after refreshing the page.
